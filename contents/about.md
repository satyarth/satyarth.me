My name is Satyarth, and I'm a physicist living in Moscow. I'm currently doing Part II Physics at Cambridge University.

I like messing around with code, and try to make anything interesting I write available on [GitHub](https://github.com/satyarth) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/accden).

I'm heavily involved in the [CU Physics Society](http://physics.soc.srcf.net/wiki/index.php) and the [CU Computing and Technology Society](http://cucats.soc.srcf.net/).

I'm a fan of PC games, most notably [Dota 2](https://yasp.co/players/39733746). Think you can [1v1 me m8](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999999474/)?
