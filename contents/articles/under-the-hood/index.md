The website is generated by [wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/), a static website generator written on top of Node.js. Not a fanboy, it was the first one I tried and I'm reasonably happy with it. It's hosted on [divshot](http://divshot.io/), the free tier is more than enough for my needs. The domain's registered with [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and DNS services are provided by [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Everything except the domain is completely free (the domain was free for the first year with the Github Student Developer Pack).
