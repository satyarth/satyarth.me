This website is generated with [wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/), a static website generator written on top of Node.js. The source for the website is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/satyarth/satyarth.me). It was first hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), then [divshot](http://divshot.io/), and now lives on a [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) VPS and is served via [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/). The domain is registered with [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and DNS services are provided by [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

I've tried to make it simple, lightweight, and sexy. Except for web fonts (and MathJax on certain pages), no external resources are required. If you have suggestions, I'd love to [hear them](http://satyarth.me/#contact).
