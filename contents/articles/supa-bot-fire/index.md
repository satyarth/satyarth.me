I wrote a bot that replies to people's tweets in the style of [Supa Hot Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ChppfnazzE/). While the primary goal was dank memes, it also served as a nice introduction to natual language processing and the Twitter API.

**Update**: The bot got banned. RIP in peace.
